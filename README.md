Various projects done in CPSC 335 at CSUF

## Alternating disks
Algorithm that sorts disks using the lawnmower algorithm

## Crane unloading problem
Implementation of two algorithms that both solve the crane unloading problem. The first algorithm uses exhaustive optimization and takes exponential time. The second algorithm uses dynamic programming, and takes cubic time.

## Greedy vs Exhaustive Search
Compares the time efficiency of greedy and exhaustive search algorithms 

## Clustering a Sensor network using NIC addresses
Implements one algorithm related to hash tables that can aid various distributed algorithms to group sensors. This project is about reading a fairly small number of distinct Network Interface Controllers (NICs), each being a 6-digit number in hexadecimal) and deciding which digit among the six gives the best balanced distribution of the NICs.
